%% Make a sketch with 10 samples of one realization X(n) of the process i.e. for n = 0,..,10 
a = 0;
b = 10;
n = b - a + 1;

%% 2) Find the ensemble mean value and the variance for the process X(n).
mu = (a+b)/2
var = 1/12*(b-a)^2

%% 3) Find the autocorrelation RXX(tau) for the process X(n) for tau = 0,.., 3.


%% 4)  State whether the process is WSS (wide sense stationary) and whether 
%      it is ergodic, specify the reason behind your answers.
